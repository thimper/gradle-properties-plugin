# The second set is meant to test setting Java System properties from gradle
# properties.  The systemProp prefix is a Gradle requirement. the property
# name itself is meant to be different from the build properties above. We
# don't need an environmentProp because we can't set an environment variable
# with a dot.  We don't need a systemProp because we don't read system
# properties to write other system properties.
